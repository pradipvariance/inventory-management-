Role-Based Functional Flow – Inventory Management System
1. Super Admin

Only the Super Admin can create a new warehouse.

The Super Admin can add additional fields to the warehouse table, such as capacity.

The Super Admin can select warehouses when initiating stock transfers between warehouses.

The system continuously monitors stock levels in each warehouse.

If stock falls below the minimum limit, the system triggers a low-stock alert.

The Super Admin can view all low-stock alerts.

After reviewing the alert, the Super Admin can create a Purchase Order (PO) by:

Selecting a supplier

Selecting products

Entering quantity

Setting a delivery date

The system sends the purchase order to the selected supplier.

2. Warehouse Admin

The Warehouse Admin can:

View and monitor stock levels in their assigned warehouse.

Approve internal stock transfers.

3. Inventory Manager

The Inventory Manager can:

Add stock to a warehouse.

Deduct stock from a warehouse.

Manage product quantities.

Maintain and update inventory records.

4. Supplier

The Supplier can:

View purchase orders assigned to them.

Confirm or reject purchase orders.

Deliver stock to the warehouse.

After delivery:

The warehouse receives the stock.

The inventory is updated.

The purchase order is marked as Completed.

5. Customer

Customers can only view and access information related to their own accounts and orders.
